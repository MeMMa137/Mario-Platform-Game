This Java code replicates the famous Mario Bros game.

ðŸ‘¾TO RUN:
Apache NetBeans IDE 16 was used for development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
You can play it directly from the IDE or using programs that support the graphical interface of .java files.
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order not to encounter errors.
I would like to point out that part of the program was created following a tutorial, but applying several changes, making it original and more particular. (for Hack Club reviewers, the code has already been approved by 2 admins!)
